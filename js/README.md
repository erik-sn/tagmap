### NPM Scripts
- <b>new</b>: generate a new React component in the `/src`/ directory. This takes one mandatory argument, the
component's name, and one optional component, `class` or `redux`. By default a function component is generated,
if `class` is passed then a `React.Component` class is generated, and if `redux` is passed a class with `mapStateToProps`
and `mapDispatchToProps` is generated with the `connect` function.

Example:

    ```bash
    npm run new NavbarContainer redux
    ```

- <b>dev</b>: start the development server which runs by default on port 3000 and has hot reloading
- <b>test</b>: Run all tests inside the __tests__ directory
- <b>tdd</b>: Run test in watch mode, after every save the tests are re-run (test driven design)
- <b>cover</b>: Run test and generate a coverage report indicating which code was executed while tests were ran. HTML report
is added to the `/coverage` directory
- <b>lint</b>: run eslint on the src directory to fix any trivial formatting issues and raise issue for more serious ones
- <b>build</b>: run the webpack build configuration to compile into ES5 javascript in the /dist directory.
- <b>start</b>: start the production server which hosts the minified/uglified versions of javascript/css files and supports
server side rendering with React Router & Redux. Designed for use in production, runs by default on port 4000.
